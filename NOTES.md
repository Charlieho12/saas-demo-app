# Development Notes & Changelog

## Architecture Decisions

### Framework & Stack Choice
- **Next.js 15 with App Router**: Chosen for its mature ecosystem, server components, and excellent developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Essential for large applications to prevent runtime errors and improve maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach allows rapid UI development without custom CSS overhead
- **Prisma + SQLite**: Type-safe database access with easy migration path to PostgreSQL for production

### Authentication Strategy
- **NextAuth.js**: Battle-tested solution with extensive provider support
- **JWT Sessions**: Stateless sessions for better scalability vs database sessions
- **Credentials Provider**: Email/password authentication for simplicity
- **bcryptjs**: Industry standard for password hashing

### Database Design
- **User-Subscription 1:1**: Each user can have one subscription, simplifying business logic
- **User-Video 1:Many**: Users can save multiple videos
- **Role Enum**: Simple USER/ADMIN roles, extensible for future role types
- **Stripe ID Storage**: Store customer and subscription IDs for webhook processing

## Security Implementations

### Authentication Security
- ✅ Password hashing with salt rounds (bcrypt default 12)
- ✅ JWT tokens with secure secret
- ✅ Session-based route protection
- ✅ Server-side authentication verification

### Authorization Controls
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Subscription-based feature gating
- ✅ Admin route protection at middleware level
- ✅ API endpoint authorization

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ YouTube URL validation with regex patterns
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ String length limits and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- ✅ XSS prevention via React's built-in escaping

### Stripe Security
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Test mode only implementation
- ✅ Idempotent webhook processing
- ✅ Secure customer/subscription handling

## Trade-offs & Compromises

### Development Speed vs Security
- **Trade-off**: Basic password requirements (6+ chars) vs complex requirements
- **Rationale**: Demo application prioritizes setup speed, production would need stronger requirements
- **Future**: Implement password strength meter, complexity requirements

### Database Choice
- **Trade-off**: SQLite vs PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: SQLite for simple local development, easy to migrate to PostgreSQL
- **Future**: Production deployment should use PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Session Management
- **Trade-off**: JWT vs Database sessions
- **Rationale**: JWT for stateless scalability, simpler deployment
- **Consideration**: Database sessions provide better security (revocation), but increase complexity

### Rate Limiting
- **Trade-off**: In-memory vs Redis/Database rate limiting
- **Rationale**: In-memory for simplicity, loses state on restart
- **Future**: Implement Redis-based rate limiting for production

## Bug Fixes & Issues Resolved

### Issue: Stripe API Version Compatibility
- **Problem**: Type errors with Stripe subscription objects
- **Solution**: Cast to `any` for specific properties, update to latest API version
- **Prevention**: Regular dependency updates, better type definitions

### Issue: NextAuth Adapter Type Conflicts
- **Problem**: PrismaAdapter causing type conflicts with NextAuth
- **Solution**: Removed adapter, used JWT-only sessions
- **Trade-off**: Lost automatic user/session table management

### Issue: Route Protection Timing
- **Problem**: Client-side redirects happening before server checks
- **Solution**: Server-side authentication in page components + middleware
- **Result**: Better security, fewer loading flashes

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- ✅ Prisma includes/selects for efficient queries
- ✅ Indexed fields (email, stripeCustomerId)
- ⚠️ Could add pagination for video lists
- ⚠️ Could implement query caching

### Client-Side Performance
- ✅ Server components where possible
- ✅ Minimal client-side JavaScript
- ⚠️ Could implement image optimization for video thumbnails
- ⚠️ Could add virtual scrolling for large video lists

### Bundle Size
- ✅ Tree-shaking with ES modules
- ✅ Minimal dependencies
- ⚠️ Could implement code splitting for admin panel
- ⚠️ Could lazy-load video player components

## Testing Strategy

### What Would Be Tested in Production
- **Unit Tests**: YouTube URL validation, security utilities
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with test database
- **E2E Tests**: Authentication flow, subscription process
- **Security Tests**: SQL injection, XSS prevention
- **Load Tests**: Rate limiting, concurrent users

### Current Testing Approach
- Manual testing with test cards
- Stripe webhook testing with CLI
- Database migrations tested locally
- Security through code review

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
- All secrets properly externalized
- Test vs production key separation
- Database URL environment-specific
- Webhook endpoint configuration

### Database Migration
- SQLite → PostgreSQL for production
- Connection pooling (PgBouncer/Prisma)
- Backup strategy implementation
- Migration rollback procedures

### Monitoring & Logging
- Error tracking (Sentry/similar)
- Performance monitoring
- Security event logging
- Webhook delivery monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (Essential for Production)
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] PostgreSQL migration
- [ ] Redis rate limiting
- [ ] Error monitoring
- [ ] Security headers

### Priority 2 (Feature Improvements)
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Video categories/tags
- [ ] Search functionality

### Priority 3 (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Multiple subscription tiers
- [ ] Team/organization support
- [ ] API rate limiting per user
- [ ] Advanced admin analytics
- [ ] Webhook retry mechanism

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Modular architecture made features easy to add
- TypeScript caught many potential runtime errors
- Prisma schema made database changes straightforward
- Security-first approach prevented common vulnerabilities

### What Could Be Improved
- More comprehensive error handling
- Better loading states throughout app
- More granular permission system
- Automated testing from the start

### Key Takeaways
- Server-side validation is crucial even with client-side checks
- Webhook idempotency prevents duplicate processing
- Route protection needs both middleware and component-level checks
- Environment variable organization is critical for deployment
